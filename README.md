- 👋 Hi, I’m immy

- Tech industry is constantly evolving especially cloud computing is on the rise, being a tech savvy, I decided to change my career from a sales professional to a cloud practitioner.

Detail- oriented and problem solver, ability to work under pressure and adapting to new situation that made me successful in my previous career are also what allows to quickly adapt to IT development.

The future of cloud computing excites me especially
Data Science, AI & Machine Learning.

I value honesty, loyalty, and knack for identifying best practice and gaps in systems and a team player who is willing to go above and beyond with whatever projects I am working on.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small project where I can contribute and learn at the same time...
